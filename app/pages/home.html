    <hr>
    <br>
      <p>
        Pioneers in Engineering's Final Competition is the last event of the robotics competition season.
        This year, we had over 200 high school students from 18 high schools competing to see who could
        build the best robot. The Final Competition is where they finally get to pit their robots against each other
        to win it all in this year's game, Dry Another Day.

        We are Pioneers in Engineering (PiE), a student-run organization that promotes
        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education through an exciting,
        mentorship-based process. We believe that no student should be denied an education in
        STEM.
